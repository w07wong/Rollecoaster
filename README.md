# Rollercoaster
Purpose is to randomly generated rollercoaster that obeys the laws of physics.  Will give user all the measurements in meters and seconds on a table.  Was for a physics project where students were to design a rollercoaster on paper.  Unfortunately, deadlines limited how far I got with this project before using pencil and paper instead.
